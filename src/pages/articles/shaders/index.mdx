# Introduction

This project is different from everything I did before. I aimed to create something unique, something that ignores the principles of human-centered design and is purely build upon the content it conveys.
No grid, no conventions, no Roboto.

Wrangling for the frontmost place on the floor, looking up from time to time, to the woman sitting on a fur against the wall of the bunker. Everyone wanted to make sure they still preserved a decent distance between them and her. A few hours ago a group of colony hunters found her outside.

## The Book of Shaders

I admire the power of shaders, so little code to generate complex generative artworks – it amazed me from the first second.
The website ["The Book of Shaders"](https://thebookofshaders.com/) helped me a lot in learning this language. I enjoyed the little interactive blocks the site integrates to let the user grasp the topic and learn one crucial thing about shaders: it is all about trial and error in the beginning.

Like learning any new language, repetition is vital. I created a medium that embraces this fact. One that would help others in staying committed. To learn repeatedly, by taking part in a compelling story. Each week another chapter will continue said story, with new challenges, pieces of training and a ton of shader magic to stay motivated.
